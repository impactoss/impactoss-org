# Contribute to open source project

## Development

You can contribute by
* developing new features independently on the userâ€™s own code base and later integrating it with the core open source project in coordination with its maintainers, the IMPACT OSS Group, or
* directly developing new features as part of the core open source project in close collaboration with its maintainers.

Please note that for both contribution options it would be required to contract the services of the IMPACT OSS Group for the coordination efforts or otherwise sponsor the IMPACT OSS Group for the continued maintenance efforts.

## Programming knowledge

For the server, knowledge of Ruby-on-Rails is required and for the client JavaScript, more specifically ReactJS.
