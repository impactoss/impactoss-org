#### Core Values

# Transparency | Accountability | Open collaboration | Equality | Non-discrimination | Respect | Dignity | Consensual decision making

## Transparency, accountability and open collaboration

The Trustees are united in their commitment to the core values of the Trust and seek to advance these principles in the course of the organisationâ€™s work and governance. Transparency and accountability are core characteristics of any software developed or supported by the Trust, as is being open source in nature.

## Equality, non-discrimination, respect and dignity

All technologies the Trust is associated with seek to advance the fundamental principles underpinning human rights norms and laws.

## Consensual decision making

The Trust Deed which establishes the Impact Open Source Software Trust sets out a decision making process rooted firmly in consensual decision making. Equality is also at the heart of the Trust constitution which seeks to establish a gender balance on the Board at any time. We are therefore always seeking applications from interested parties - please email your CV and expression of interest to info@impactoss.org to be considered.
