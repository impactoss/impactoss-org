Transparency, accountability open collaboration - The Trustees are united in their commitment to the core values of the Trust and seek to advance these principles in the course of the organisationâ€™s work and governance. Transparency and accountability are core characteristics of any software developed or supported by the Trust, as is being open source in nature.

Equality, non-discrimination, respect and dignity - All technologies the Trust is associated with seek to advance the fundamental principles underpinning human rights norms and laws.

Consensual decision making - The Trust Deed which establishes the Impact Open Source Software Trust sets out a decision making process rooted firmly in consensual decision making. Equality is also at the heart of the Trust constitution which seeks to establish a gender balance on the Board at any time. We are therefore always seeking applications from interested parties - please email your CV and expression of interest to info@impactoss.org to be considered.  

Partners


Universal Rights Group - The Trust and URG signed an MOU in October 2017 in recognition of their shared aim to advance the implementation agenda through the use of technology. Through the partnership URG leverages its networks and influence within Geneva and the human rights sector to test, develop, and generate interest and funds for the improvement and application of IMPACT OSS.
