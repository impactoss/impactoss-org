## How to get started with IMPACT OSS
To start using IMPACT OSS the following initial tasks are required:
* Configure client and server application code
* Install client and server applications on suitable web services

In addition, it may be necessary initially (or at a later stage) to:
Customise and enhance application functionality.

For the ongoing operation of IMPACT OSS, the following tasks are required
* Host client and server applications
* Backup server database and document store
* Provide support in case of issues arising from defects and user error

In addition, it is best to sporadically
* Update application code when new core versions become available

## Free and open source

The source code for both server and client is open source and freely available under the MIT license. Anyone is therefore permitted to make a copy of the source code, change it, and install it on suitable web servers without any financial obligation to the IMPACT OSS Group as long as any modifications are also open source.

However, the IMPACT OSS group strongly encourages users to make any significant independent enhancements available to all other users by contributing them to the core open source project.
