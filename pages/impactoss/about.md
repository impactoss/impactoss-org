# About IMPACT OSS

**IMPACT OSS** is an _Open Source Software_ (OSS) for _Integrated Management and Planning of ACTions_ (IMPACT) that is maintained by the **Impact Open Source Software Trust**.

IMPACT OSS is the result of combining the development efforts for [Sadata](https://sadata-production.firebaseapp.com), Samoa's Database for its NMRF (National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up), and the [New Zealand National Plan of Action](https://npa.hrc.co.nz) managed by the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission](https://hrc.co.nz). Further enhancements and documentation was made possible thanks to our partner [Universal Rights Group](https://www.universal-rights.org/) and the [Permanent Mission of Singapore, Geneva](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/geneva.html).

IMPACT OSS consists of a [server application](https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-server) (the 'API') that manages the database, user authentication and automated emails, and a [client application](https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-client) (the 'UI') that serves as the user interface for both the public and admin users.

All project code and related documentation are released under an [MIT Open Source License](https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-client/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that allows any person or organisation to **use, modify and distribute the software free of charge** as long as the original copyright and license notice is included.

# Roadmap

We are committed to continue improving IMPACT OSS. In particular, we are currently planning the following improvements

#### Integration of third party developments

* **Accessibility**: as part of the enhancements for its National Plan of Action, the NZ Human Rights Commission has provided funding to make IMPACT OSS accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.0. Development is still ongoing and expected to be made available to all installations of IMPACT OSS in December 2018.

#### Other planned enhancement (subject to funding or third party developments)

* **PDF exporting**
* **Improved indicators** (distinguish progress and outcome indicators)
* **Data visualisation component**
* **Prominent recommendation clusters**: strengthen role of recommendation clusters
* **Automated clustering** using machine learning
* **Multilanguage support**
