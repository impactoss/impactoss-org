Services: Installation & customisation, hosting & support, user training


The IMPACT OSS Group offers all required and optional tasks described above as a comprehensive service, but can also offer only a subset of the tasks if other tasks are provided by independent suppliers. Furthermore, the IMPACT OSS Group would also offer their support independent suppliers if needed. It is also possible to just copy the source code and fully rely on independent suppliers without the help of the IMPACT OSS Group.
